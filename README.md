## Problem Statement
<font size="4.5">***"How can we determine the age of a person given their portrait?"***</font>

## The Data
You've been supplied with a dataset of images depicting people from a wide range of ages.\
The filenames end in the format "_YYYY-MM-DD_yyyy.jpg"; "YYYY" being the year of birth and "yyyy" the year of photo capture. \
You have 2 alternatives to pulling the dataset into your development environment:
- Via Data Version Control within the repository \
OR
- Direct download from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfLlrkXrl8wmX3J8_Oq9RT9cwEWBpJRM/view?usp=sharing) or this [link](https://storage.googleapis.com/mle-tech-screen-data/images.tar.gz).

Feel free to augment the dataset (providing reasoning for your choice of dataset)...

## Guidance
**You have 2 hours to wireframe and solve this problem.**
- Use any and all resources available to you in your attempt. Be transparent about your sources (even data or code from The Internet).
- Focus on demonstrating your thought process and mastery of the Data Science Model Development Lifecycle over finishing the task.

## Considerations
What ethical concerns do you have with the problem statement and the given dataset?\
If possible, how would you allay these concerns?

How would you explain your solution's decisions to:
- Technical stakeholders?
- Non-technical stakeholders?
